# easy-scp

## Overview

When scp-ing files from a remote to local machine (and vice-versa), you often have to enter a very verbose command, and must get the path correct. Additionally, you're probably hitting the same set of remote machines. 

A decent solution is to have:
+ One-time initial configuration setup
+ Daily usage involving aliase leveraging configuration

This would eliminate error and save keystrokes and time in the long run.
